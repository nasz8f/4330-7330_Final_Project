## Differences

* Arrays: The syntax of declaring C# arrays is different from that of C++ arrays. The tokens "[]" appear following the array type in C#.
* The long type: In C#, the long data type is 64 bits, while in C++, it is 32 bits.
* The switch statement: Unlike the C++ switch statement, C# does not support fall through from one case label to another.
* Constructors: Similar to C++, if you don't provide a class constructor in C#, a default constructor is automatically generated for you. The default constructor initializes all the fields to their default values.
* In C#, method parameters cannot have default values. Use method overloads if you want to achieve the same effect.
* C# does not support bit fields.
* The Main method is declared differently from the main function in C++. Also, compare the usage of the command-line arguments for each language.

## Similarities

* The bool type: There is no conversion between the bool type and other types (specifically int).
* both have system garbage collection
* both have strict compiler conditions which are checked such as array  indexes, initialisation of variables before use etc
* both can perform reflection.
* both have excellent exception handling.
