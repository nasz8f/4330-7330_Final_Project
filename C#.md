### Language Purpose:
 *  When Microsoft developed .Net they developed Pool alogn with it.  By the time .Net was publibly announced in July 2000, it was announced that Pool was renamed to C# for legal reasons. The creator of C# stated that flaws in most OO languages (one of which being C++) drove CLR which drove the design of C#.
 
 
 * While people believed that a new programming language was not needed, C# was developed, derived from C and C++.  It was created to fix problems in C/C++ such as memory leaks, difficulty writing multithreaded applications, static linking, overly complex multiple inheritence rules...etc, making these functions of these languages easier to use.  The end product ended up being very similar to java.

### Features:
* Pointers are missing in C#.
* Unsafe operations such as direct memory manipulation are not allowed.
* In C# there is  no usage of "::" or "->" operators.
* Since it's on .NET, it inherits the features of automatic memory management and garbage collection.
* Varying ranges of the primitive types like Integer,Floats etc.
* Integer values  of 0 and 1 are no longer accepted as boolean values.Boolean values are pure true or false values in C# so no more errors of "="operator and "=="operator.
* "==" is used for comparison operation and "=" is used for assignment operation.
* C# supports Data Encapsulation, inheritance,polymorphism, interfaces.
* (int,float, double) are not objects in java but C# has introduces structures(structs) which enable the primitive types to become objects.

### Name Spaces:
 * There are two ways namespaces are implemented in C#, one way is using the .NET framework to organize classes.  For example, 'System' is a namespace and 'Console' is a class in said namespace.  To implement this you would type 'System.Console' followed by a command.  If at the top of the program you write 'using [namespace]' for example, 'using System', the name of the namespace would not have to be written before the name of the class each time. The second way of implementing namespaces  is to declare a namespace at the beginning of a program using the keyword 'namespace' followed by a custom name for the namespace.  This allows you to create your own namespace instead of using a default one.  Implementing namespaces allows you to organize large projects.
 
 * The keyword namespace declares a scope that contains a set of objects.  Namespaces can be used to create globally unique types as well as organize elements in your code. A namespace may declare things such as an interface, class, enum, struct, and delegate, as well as another namespace.  If a namespace is not added to a project, the compiler will add a default namespace named 'root'.

### Types:
* Short Name : type

  byte Unsigned : integer

  sbyte Signed : integer

  int Signed : integer 

  uint Unsigned : integer 

  short Signed : integer 

  ushort Unsigned : integer 

  long Signed : integer 

  ulong Unsigned : integer

  float Single-precision : floating point type

  double Double-precision : floating point type 

  char A single Unicode : character 

  bool Logical : Boolean type

  object Base type of all other types 

  string A sequence of characters 

  decimal Precise fractional or integral type that can represent decimal numbers with 29 significant digits 


 * C# supports both value and reference types. When a variable is declared using one of the basic, built-in data types or a user defined structure, it is a value type. An exception is the string data type, which is a reference type. A value type stores its contents in memory allocated on the stack. In contrast, a reference type, such as an instance of a class or an array, is allocated in a different area of memory called the heap. 

* New value types can be created in C#. With user-defined types, use new to invoke the default constructor.
