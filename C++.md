### Language Purpose:
  * C++ was designed by Bjarne Stroustup. He wanted to create a C like language with more features introduced in higher level languages. He created "C with classes" until 1983 when the name was changed to c++
  * the bigest issue Stroustup had with c was adding data abstraction and also creating an object oriented language. Another issue he had with c was distributing operating system facilities across a network.

 * Abstraction
 
 * Polymorphism
 
 * Inheritance

### Name Spaces:
 * In C++ namespaces are declared at the beginning of a program using the keyword 'namespace' followed by a custom name for the namespace.  This allows you to create your own namespace instead of using a default one.  This is very similar to the second way namespaces are implemented in C#.
 
 * In C++ namespaces encapsulate each version of an interface nested inside the parent, which is the namespace.

   long long
   
   float
   
   double
   
   long double
   
   bool
   
   void
   
   decltype(nullptr)
   
 * C++ does support both value and reference types.
 
 * New value types can be created in C++. With user-defined types, you can use new to invoke the default constructor.

### Classes:
 * A class can be defined choosing an access level such as publuc, private, protected, or default. This is followed by the keyword 'class' and then the custom name of your class.

* A new object, or instance, can be created in a class by using the 'new' keyword, followed by the name of the class that the instance is based on.

* When initializing a class, its constructor is called. To create a class's constructor an access level must be chosen, followed by the keyword 'class' since the constructor shares the same name as the class and it's custom name. This is to be created somewhere above the class that uses it. The class can then be instantiated using the constructor by using the keyword 'new'.
 
* In C++ a class may only have one deconstructor which can't be called. A deconstructor is invoked automatically. It doesn't hve modifiers or parameters. A deconstructor may be created by calling the keyword 'class' with the class's custom name. Inside of the brackets of this, the name of the class preceded by a '~' and followed by '()'. This will deconstruct a class.

### Instance Reference in Data Type:
* C++ supports both this and self.  'this' is a keyword while 'self' is a variable.  'This' always refers to the object that is executing a particular method.  'self' variables may be modified during execution.  For example, A constructor may assign a 'self' variable to nil on failure.

### Properties:
 * In C++ getters and setters are not built in, you must write your own.
 
 * Backing variables do exist in C++.
 
 * Computed properties do not exist in C++
